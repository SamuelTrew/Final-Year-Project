This project covers a number of exciting areas of Computer Science such as Machine Learning and Privacy Engineering. 
I will be covering each in turn and also giving a more detailed analyses where it is deemed relevant to the project.
This project makes the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The attacks that are carried out only involve interfering with the models, their parameters, their data etc. They do not involve network security based attacks or attacks that involve external agents in manners such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack.
    
    \item The Machine Learning Models for the specific datasets tested are in their ideal form for the datasets used and do not require further fine tuning for the distributed systems nature of this work. Fine tuning the hyper-parameters of these models specifically is out of the scope for this project.
\end{enumerate}

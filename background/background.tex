This project covers an exciting area of Computer Science with Machine Learning and Federated Learning.
This chapter will be discussing each in turn and also giving a more detailed analyses where it is deemed relevant to the project.
This project makes the following assumptions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The attacks that are carried out only interfere with the models, their parameters and their data. They do not involve network security based attacks or attacks that involve external agents in manners such as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack.
    This is because these external agents are not unique to Federated Learning and have nothing to do with its process or how it is implemented.
    
    \item The Machine Learning Models' hyperparameters are optimal to the datasets we test on. Further, that we do not require additional fine tuning for it to achieve optimal performance in the context of a distributed system. Fine tuning the hyper-parameters of these models specifically is out of the scope for this project.
\end{enumerate}
